     <h1> Problem solving </h1>If I had a dollar for every problem I've needed help
      solving throughout these sprints I'd be a millionaire by now . I saw a
      quote while researching problem solving methods and techniques and it said
      “a good problem solver is an excellent coder” . That's really stuck in my
      head , so by being good at one thing you become excellent in another ? I
      really hope so. At first I didn't really put much focus into the whole
      problem solving methods , I was just trying to tackle the challenges and
      then hit a brick wall and pull my hair out . But I now realise how crucial
      it is to have a good problem solving plan . It not only helps you figure
      things out effectively but it really takes a lot of stress off your wairua.

    <h2>Problem Solving Steps</h2>
    <p>There are several steps to take when it comes to problem solving Problem
      Solving Skills for Coding Analyze the problem: Identify and understand the
      problem you want to solve. Break down the problem into manageable
      components: Divide the problem into smaller, more manageable pieces.
      Research and explore various solutions: Look for different methods that
      can solve each component of the problem. Evaluate and select the best
      method: Choose the approach that solves the problem most correctly and
      efficiently. Implement the solution: Apply the chosen solution to solve
      the original problem. Test the solution: Make sure the solution works by
      testing it thoroughly, and if the approach doesn’t work, go back and try
      another solution.
