    <h1>Human Skills</h1>
    <p>
      What surprised me the most about Human Skills learning is how it impacted
      my understanding of myself , my relationships and interactions with
      others, not just within my studies but in everyday life . It was actually
      such a lovely part to have incorporated in to our studies and curriculum
      because it was exactly what I needed, it was a great reminder about how
      important it is to look after your well being and I loved the part about
      Neuroplasticity. Also how emotional intelligence plays a crucial role .

    <h2>
      What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due
      to the Human Skills learning?
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Self awareness: Ive learned that this is so important in your personal
        life and professional settings. Understanding my strengths and
        weaknesses helped me to approach tasks and challenges better.
      </li>
      <li>
        Empathy: Something i thought i already had lots of but after this i
        realised i needed to focus on having more empathy in some situations so
        that I can better understand others and their perspectives . This has
        improved my communication and listening skills .
      </li>
      <li>
        Ego: I have realsied that my ego can sometimes get in the way of
        learning. Egos can always do with a bit of tweaking so definitely
        something to keep on top of.
